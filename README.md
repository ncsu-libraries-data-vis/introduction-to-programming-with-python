# Introduction to Programming with Python

These materials introduce fundamental concepts of programming through the Python programming language. Originally incorporated into hands-on workshop delivered as part of the NC State Univeristy Libraries' Data & Visualization Workshop Series, these materials provide a core understanding of variables, data types, control flow, functions, and basic data structures.

To get started, click on one of the **Open in Colab** buttons below to open an interactive Python notebook in the browser-based Google Colaboratory environment. Each notebook includes explanations, runnable example code, and activities. Each notebook is accompanied by a completed notebook that includes all example code and filled activities. The completed notebook can be used as a reference and to check answers to activities. You can find a link to the completed notebook at the end of each notebook.

    "For this activity we have membership information for 25 members of the *International Cats of Mystery* service stored in the file `international_cats_of_mystery.txt`. The file is formatted as follows:\n",

    "1. Each line is seperated by a newline character (`\\n`)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first line in the file contains the data variable names (e.g., Name, Joined, Address 1,...)\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Each variable name or value is seperated by semicolons (`;`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our job is to read in the `international_cats_of_mystery.txt` file, parse the data, and format the data to create a list of dictionaries containing membership information that match the format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{'address 1': '12309 Scratch Tree Lane',\n",
